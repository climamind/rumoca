# WASM, LSP, and Editors

The same compiler serves three editor surfaces: the `rumoca-lsp` language
server (native, bundled with the VS Code extension), the WASM bindings
(browser playground and the live examples in these books), and the CLI's
terminal diagnostics. They share `rumoca-tool-lsp` for language smarts, so
completion and diagnostics behave identically everywhere.

## Crates and Directories

| Location | Role |
|---|---|
| `rumoca-tool-lsp` | Language-server logic: diagnostics, completion, hover, semantic tokens, definitions, code actions |
| `rumoca-tool-fmt`, `rumoca-tool-lint` | Formatter and linter (CLI + LSP + WASM) |
| `rumoca-bind-wasm` | `wasm-bindgen` API: compile, simulate, simulation sessions, source-root management, LSP functions |
| `rumoca-bind-python` | Python bindings (`pip install rumoca`) |
| `packages/rumoca` | npm/WASM package builder; generated packages land under `packages/rumoca/dist/` |
| `packages/rumoca-web` | Hand-written browser runtime, WebGPU/diffsol drivers, visualization code, and vendored web dependencies |
| `packages/vscode` | VS Code extension (TypeScript) |
| `packages/playground` | Browser playground (Monaco workbench over the WASM package) |
| `docs/user-guide/live/` | The books' live-example harness (mini Monaco editors over the same WASM package) |

## The WASM API Surface

`rumoca-bind-wasm` exposes the pipeline to JavaScript:

- `compile(source, model)` → DAE JSON; `render_target(...)` renders a
  DAE-level target (the books' **Show DAE** uses the `dae-modelica`
  target).
- `simulate_model(source, model, t_end, dt, solver, parameter_overrides_json)`
  → result payload with `names`/`allData`/`nStates` plus request/timing
  metadata. Passing `t_end = 0`, `dt = 0`, `solver = ""` defers to the
  model's `experiment` annotation. `parameter_overrides_json` is a JSON object
  whose keys are tunable parameter names and whose values are finite numbers.
- `model_parameter_metadata(source, model_name)` → tunable parameter metadata used
  by the shared scenario GUI before writing `[parameters]` overrides.
- `WasmSimulationSession` — user-terminated interactive simulation with
  `withInteractiveOptions`, `set_input`, `advance_to`, and `get`; the session
  extends its finite solver horizon as it runs.
- `lsp_diagnostics` / `lsp_completion` / `lsp_hover` /
  `lsp_semantic_tokens` … — thin wrappers over `rumoca-tool-lsp` used by
  the playground workers and the books' editors.
- Source-root management (`load_source_roots`, parsed-document caches,
  bundled archives) so browser sessions can host package trees.

## Build and Test

```bash
cargo xtask playground build  # wasm-pack build into packages/rumoca/dist/<profile>/
cargo xtask playground test   # CI gate: build + browser smoke tests (Playwright)
cargo xtask vscode test       # VS Code extension gate
cargo xtask docs serve        # local books with live examples and WASM package
```

The Pages deployment copies the WASM package, the playground, and both
books into one artifact — see [Docs and Pages](../tooling/docs-and-pages.md).

## One Language Definition

Monaco's Modelica language definition (tokenizer, comments, brackets) lives
in `packages/rumoca-web/runtime/modelica_language.js` and is imported by both
the playground and the books' live harness. Edit it there only — the books
load it dynamically from the deployed package layout.
