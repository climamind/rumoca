# SPEC_0023: Crate Architecture for MLS Compliance

## Status
DRAFT

## Summary
Maps SPEC_0022 (MLS Compiler Compliance) data structures and phases to rumoca crate organization.

## Design Rationale

### MLS Flexibility

The MLS explicitly allows implementation flexibility:

> "An implementation may delay and/or omit building parts of these trees, which means that the different steps can be interleaved." — MLS §5.6

The spec defines **logical** phases (Instantiation → Flattening) but does **not** mandate how to organize code.

### Industry Practice

Research into existing Modelica compilers reveals a preference for **explicit phase separation**:

- Separating instantiation, type checking, and flattening into distinct phases is standard practice in multi-pass compilers (see *Engineering a Compiler*, Cooper & Torczon).
- The Modelica Specification (MLS §5.6) defines these as logically distinct operations.
- JModelica/OPTIMICA uses JastAdd attribute grammars with declarative phase specifications where name analysis, type analysis, and flattening are separate concerns.

### Recommendation

**Keep phases in separate crates.** The evidence shows that:

1. **Performance**: Clean boundaries enable independent optimization
2. **Debugging**: Clear responsibility per phase simplifies diagnosis
3. **Incremental compilation**: Change isolation enables selective recompilation
4. **Testing**: Each phase can be tested in isolation

The MLS says you *may* interleave, not that you *should*. Successful compilers tend toward explicit phases with well-defined IR boundaries.

## Pipeline Mapping

```
MLS Phase          | rumoca Phase Crate           | rumoca IR Crate
-------------------|------------------------------|------------------
Parsing (§2,§13)   | rumoca-phase-parse           | rumoca-ir-ast
Name Resolution    | rumoca-phase-resolve         | rumoca-ir-resolved
Type Checking      | rumoca-phase-typecheck       | rumoca-ir-typed
Instantiation(§5.6)| rumoca-phase-instantiate     | rumoca-ir-inst
Flattening (§5.6)  | rumoca-phase-flatten         | rumoca-ir-flat
DAE Formation(App B)| rumoca-phase-dae          | rumoca-ir-dae
Code Generation    | rumoca-phase-codegen         | (solver-specific)
```

### Phase Separation Rationale

The MLS groups "Parsing" conceptually, but rumoca separates it into three phases following standard multi-pass compiler design:

| Phase | Responsibility | Why Separate |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| **Parse** | Syntax → AST | Lexer/parser are mechanically different from semantic analysis |
| **Resolve** | Name lookup, DefId assignment | Complex scope rules (§5) warrant isolation |
| **Typecheck** | Type inference, variability | Type checking after instantiation ensures full modifier context is available (MLS §10.1) |

Keeping instantiation and typing as distinct phases enables better error messages and incremental compilation.

## Data Structure Mapping

```

## Compile DAG Protection

To preserve strict phase boundaries and prevent accidental architectural drift:

1. Dependency direction MUST remain acyclic and phase-ordered (AST -> resolved -> typed -> inst -> flat -> dae -> simulator/codegen).
2. Phase/runtime crates MUST depend on the IR crate that defines their contract, not earlier IR crates bypassing that contract.
3. Wholesale cross-layer crate re-exports are forbidden.
: Do not add patterns like `pub use some_lower_layer_crate as alias;` to tunnel around dependency boundaries.
4. Wildcard cross-layer API forwarding is forbidden.
: Do not expose `pub use some_lower_layer_crate::*;` from a higher-level IR crate as a replacement for explicit interfaces.
5. Shared symbols crossing a layer boundary MUST be exposed explicitly from the owning IR crate (named types, aliases, or wrapper structs), with intentional review.

Rationale:
- Keeps compile-time dependency graph meaningful and reviewable.
- Prevents “shortcut imports” that hide layer violations.
- Reduces AI/new-contributor drift into convenience-based architecture erosion.

## Runtime And Simulation Layering

The compiler pipeline ends at the DAE contract. Runtime and simulation consumers must remain
layered below that contract rather than being folded back into `rumoca-compile`.

Target direction:

```
rumoca-compile / compiler entry points
    -> runtime contracts
    -> concrete solver backend
    -> stepper APIs
    -> report/payload contracts
    -> visualization/assets
```

Recommended crate mapping:

| Responsibility | Preferred Crate Role |
|----------------|----------------------|
| compile/session orchestration | `rumoca-compile` |
| transport-neutral lockstep I/O contracts | `rumoca-codec` |
| FlatBuffer schema/codec support for lockstep I/O | `rumoca-codec-flatbuffers` |
| DAE structural analysis | `rumoca-phase-structural` |
| solver-facing prepared IR, vector layout, row operations | `rumoca-ir-solve` |
| DAE-to-solve layout and row lowering | `rumoca-phase-solve-lower` |
| backend-neutral solver contracts and shared runtime helpers | `rumoca-sim-core` |
| concrete diffsol backend | `rumoca-solver-diffsol` |
| simple pure-Rust RK backend | `rumoca-solver-rk45` |
| shared stepping/runtime loop surface | `rumoca-sim-core` |
| report/payload shaping | `rumoca-sim-core` |
| web/HTML/assets | `rumoca-viz-web` |

Current app note:

- `rumoca lockstep` is the current lockstep app/example surface in the main CLI.
- It may keep the quadrotor/controller/viewer loop, but reusable protocol ownership belongs in
  `rumoca-codec` and `rumoca-codec-flatbuffers`, not in the CLI entry point.

Migration rule:

- Do not add new APIs that further couple these responsibilities.
- New CI checks should reject legacy assumptions and ratchet toward the target layering.
- CLI/bindings/export adapters and shared regression harnesses should render templates through
  `rumoca-compile::codegen`; direct `rumoca-phase-codegen` dependencies are reserved for
  phase-local codegen tests.

## Compliance Notes

### Array Preservation (SPEC_0019)
- `Variable.dims: Vec<i64>` - preserved through flatten
- `Var.dims: Vec<i64>` - preserved in DAE
- Scalarization deferred to codegen

### Model/Function Algorithm Handling (SPEC_0020)
- `Algorithm` - structured statements preserved at flat IR
- ToDae lowers supported model algorithms into DAE equations
- Unsupported model algorithm forms fail ToDae with `ED013` (no runtime compatibility storage in solver-facing DAE)
- `Function.body` is preserved in `Dae.functions` for codegen readability

### Solver-Facing DAE Boundary (SPEC_0007 + SPEC_0020)
- `rumoca-ir-dae::Dae` is the only solver-facing hybrid IR contract.
- Solver-facing DAE must carry MLS Appendix B canonical equation buckets (`f_x`, `f_z`, `f_m`, `f_c`, `relation`) plus runtime metadata (`synthetic_root_conditions`, `scheduled_time_events`, `clock_constructor_exprs`, `clock_schedules`).
- Solver-facing DAE must not include model-level `when_clauses`, `algorithms`, or `initial_algorithms`.
- Solver-facing equation partitions consumed by continuous solvers (`f_x`, `initial_equations`) must not contain unlowered synchronous operators (`sample/hold/Clock/subSample/superSample/shiftSample/backSample/noClock/firstTick/previous`); ToDae rejects these with `ED014`.
- Backend adapters (e.g. `rumoca-sim-core`) must consume this pre-lowered DAE contract and must not perform fallback semantic lowering of model algorithms/when clauses.

### Balance Checking (MLS §4.8)
- `Dae.effective_equation_count()` - counts array elements
- `Dae.effective_unknown_count()` - counts array elements
- Algorithm equations counted via `Algorithm.effective_equation_count()`

## Missing/Future Work
