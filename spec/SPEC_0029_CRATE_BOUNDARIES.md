# SPEC_0029: Crate Boundaries as Collaboration Guardrails

## Status
ACCEPTED

## Summary

Crate boundaries are compiler-enforced guardrails. A crate's `Cargo.toml` is
its reading list; illegal coupling should fail before review.

## Specification

### 1. Bounded Context Per Task

`Cargo.toml` defines what each crate can see. Read dependencies before editing.

### 2. Strict DAG Dependency Graph

No circular dependencies. Dependency tiers form an acyclic graph enforced by the
Rust compiler. See [Dependency Tiers](#dependency-tiers).

### 3. IR Crates Are Pure Data

`rumoca-ir-ast`, `rumoca-ir-flat`, and `rumoca-ir-dae` contain only data types,
display/debug implementations, and serde serialization. No evaluation logic,
phase logic, or side effects.

Allowed exception: IR crates MAY provide read-only traversal/query helpers over
their own data when those helpers have no side effects, do not evaluate
expressions, depend on phase crates, or encode backend policy.
Helpers needing modification environments, typechecking state, solver layout,
incidence data, or runtime state are not IR helpers.

IR crates MAY provide rewrite-shape helpers that recursively rebuild their own
IR nodes without semantic state. These helpers are limited to structural
ownership-preserving rewrites such as "visit every expression and allow a
caller-supplied replacement"; they MUST NOT perform name lookup, constant
evaluation, type inference, lowering, balance analysis, backend selection, or
runtime behavior. Keep read-only traversal/query helpers and rewrite-shape
helpers separate so reviewers can see observation versus mutation.

### 3a. Foundation Types Live in rumoca-core

`rumoca-core` is the **sole** Tier 1 foundation crate. It owns shared IDs,
source locations, diagnostics/`PhaseError`, shared semantic IR vocabulary, and
small shared helpers.

`SourceId`, `Span`, and `SourceMap` are owned by `rumoca-core`. `SourceId` is a
stable identity derived from a source name, not a source-map slot number. IR and
phase crates must carry `Span` values through transformations and must not add
span-rebasing sidecars.

`VarName` is the shared flattened-variable path identity. It MUST be interned
inside `rumoca-core` and expose compact process-local `VarNameId` for
equality/hash-heavy paths, while preserving string display and serialization as
the stable external representation. Downstream crates must not add sidecar
variable-name interners or serialized ID compatibility layers; if a phase needs
symbol identity beyond `VarNameId`, introduce a phase-specific ID at that
boundary.

The `VarName` interner lifecycle is process-local and monotonic. Interned text
is retained until process or WASM worker teardown so `VarNameId` stays stable
for in-process IR values still referenced by caches, diagnostics, or snapshots.
There is intentionally no public reset API. Long-running hosts must treat the
process/worker/session lifetime as the memory boundary, and must
serialize/display `VarName` as text rather than persisting `VarNameId`.

Do not create `rumoca-ir-core`, `rumoca-foundation`, or another micro-crate for
spans, diagnostics, IDs, or shared IR vocabulary without a spec update.

IR-stage-specific types belong in the matching `rumoca-ir-*` crate. A type
belongs in `rumoca-core` only if referenced by multiple IR stages or by both IR
and phase crates.

### 3b. Single-Source Helpers Across the Pipeline

Helpers referenced from multiple crates **must** have one designated
implementation.

| Helper(s) | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `balance`, `balance_detail` | `rumoca-phase-dae::balance` | DAE equation/unknown balance arithmetic |
| `runtime_defined_unknown_names`, `runtime_defined_continuous_unknown_names` | `rumoca-phase-structural::runtime_defined` | Single implementation; phase-structural is the authoritative caller. |
| `expressions_semantically_equal`, `Expression::semantically_eq_ignoring_spans` | `rumoca-core` | Shared Flat/DAE expression identity. This is structural identity only; evaluation stays in `rumoca-eval-*`. |
| `INTERNAL_SAMPLE_FUNCTION_NAME`, `source_temporal_function_name`, `source_temporal_function_short_name`, `source_temporal_builtin_name` | `rumoca-core` | Single source for source temporal operator vocabulary shared by DAE and Solve boundary validation. |
| `expr_contains_var` | `rumoca-ir-dae::expr_query` | Handles every `Expression` variant |
| `expr_refers_to_var` | `rumoca-ir-dae::expr_query` | Same single-source rule. |
| `expr_contains_der_of` | `rumoca-ir-dae::expr_query` | Same single-source rule. |
| Solver runtime time-event helpers (`event_right_limit_time`, scheduled/periodic time-event filtering, dynamic time-event parameter lookup) | `rumoca-solver::timeline` | Concrete solver backends call the shared runtime policy instead of copying time-grid rules. |
| Solver runtime event-boundary helpers (`process_runtime_event_boundary`, `runtime_event_horizon`, `runtime_root_event_application_time`, `RuntimeEventBoundaryHandler`) | `rumoca-solver::runtime::event` | Concrete solver backends provide callback hooks for backend-local row application/state reset while shared Modelica event-boundary policy stays in `rumoca-solver`. |
| Solver zero-state orchestration helpers (`run_no_state_output_schedule`, `NoStateOrchestrationBackend`, `NoStateEventStep`) | `rumoca-solver::runtime::no_state` | Concrete solver backends provide row/root/event callbacks while shared no-state output/event-loop policy stays in `rumoca-solver`. |
| Solver pre-parameter snapshot helpers (`write_pre_params_from_sources`, `update_slot`, `commit_pre_params_after_event`) | `rumoca-solver::runtime::pre_params` | Concrete solver backends call the shared pre-state write policy instead of copying `pre(...)` snapshot mechanics. |
| Solver algebraic projection helpers (`project_algebraics`, `project_algebraics_and_detect_changes`, `project_initial_*`) | `rumoca-solver::runtime::projection` | Concrete solver backends provide backend-local residual/JVP evaluation through `AlgebraicProjectionModel`; projection policy and change detection stay shared. |

Required rules:

- Every helper above has exactly one implementation, in the listed
  module. All callers MUST import from that module path.
- Do not fork helpers "for convenience." If the owner creates a forbidden
  dependency, move the helper by spec update instead.
- Adding a helper to this list requires updating this spec.

### 4. Phase Typing via Newtypes

`ParsedTree`, `ResolvedTree`, `TypedTree`, and `InstancedTree` wrap `ClassTree`.
The type system enforces phase ordering: you can't pass unresolved data to a
phase that requires resolved data. This eliminates pipeline-ordering bugs that
would otherwise require runtime checks or careful documentation.

The production compiled-model path is:

```text
ParsedTree -> ResolvedTree/ClassTree -> InstanceOverlay -> typecheck_instanced -> flat::Model -> Dae
```

`TypedTree` remains the artifact for the standalone resolved-tree typecheck API.
Model compilation uses post-instantiation type checking because modifier and
structural-parameter values are available only after instantiation.

### 5. Evaluation Decoupled from Representation

Evaluation crates are aligned to IR ownership: `rumoca-eval-ast`, `rumoca-eval-flat`, and `rumoca-eval-dae`. `rumoca-eval-solve` builds on DAE evaluation primitives for solver-facing row evaluation. This keeps evaluation entry points explicit per representation and avoids cross-layer helper crates that hide where behavior lives.

Phase crates MAY depend on the evaluation crate for the IR they are actively processing
when the phase needs compile-time evaluation of that representation. For example,
`rumoca-phase-flatten` may use `rumoca-eval-flat` for Flat-level constant and shape
evaluation instead of duplicating that logic inside the phase.

### 6. Rules for Adding Dependencies

Before adding a dependency from crate A to crate B:

1. No cycle.
2. Dependency target is lower or equal tier.
3. A `rumoca-core` trait/shared type would not be cleaner.
4. Cross-tier shortcuts are justified by spec, not convenience.

### 7. Rules for Creating New Crates

**Split when:** adding a new IR, compiler phase, data-only consumer surface, or
separating unrelated concerns. **Keep together when:** code is small, has one
consumer, or always changes as a unit.

### 8. Import and Re-export Discipline

To keep layer boundaries obvious in code (not only in `Cargo.toml`), use explicit crate namespaces.

In non-IR crates:
- Import IR crates as namespaces:
  - `use rumoca_ir_ast as ast;`
  - `use rumoca_ir_flat as flat;`
  - `use rumoca_ir_dae as dae;`
- Prefer qualified references (`ast::...`, `flat::...`, `dae::...`) over direct type imports.
- Avoid direct IR type imports such as `use rumoca_ir_flat::{Expression, VarName}` outside the owning IR crate.

Re-export guardrails:
- Non-facade crates MUST NOT re-export symbols from other Rumoca crates.
- Downstream crates import the owning crate directly; no intermediate routing.
- Wildcard forwarding is forbidden outside approved facades.
- Only approved facade crates MAY expose selected cross-crate API surfaces:

  | Facade | Scope | Allowed cross-crate exports |
  |---|---|---|
  | `rumoca-compile` | compilation/session | curated compile, parsing, codegen, analysis APIs |
  | `rumoca-sim` | simulation/runtime | solver/reporting/scheduling APIs behind features |
  | `rumoca-codec` | transport-neutral lockstep I/O | `SignalFrame`, codec traits/factories, typed codec config |

  These exports stay curated, namespaced, and documented. CLI/bindings may
  depend on facades but must not add lower-layer forwarding surfaces.
- Root/foundation crates MUST NOT act as compatibility facades for moved symbols.
  If a primitive is owned by a crate, downstream code must import it from the
  owning crate, not via re-export through an intermediate crate. For example,
  `Span` is owned by `rumoca-core` (§3a) and must be imported as
  `use rumoca_core::Span`, not via a re-export through some other crate.

CI: `architecture_hardening_test::test_no_new_cross_crate_public_exports`
rejects `pub use rumoca_*::...` and `pub type X = rumoca_*::...` in non-facade
crates.

### 9. Session Facade Root API

`rumoca-compile` is the orchestration facade crate for top-level entry points.
Its root API MUST stay minimal:

- Allowed root exports: `Session`, `SessionConfig`.
- Compile result and helper types remain under explicit namespaces such as `rumoca_compile::compile::*`.
- Non-compile helper surfaces remain under explicit namespaces (`analysis`, `parsing`, `runtime`, `source_roots`, `project`).

CI enforcement:
- Violations MUST fail CI.
- The workspace test `crates/rumoca/tests/architecture_hardening_test.rs::test_session_root_facade_exports_are_minimal`
  enforces this root export policy.

### 10. Session-Owned Source-Root And Class-Graph State

`rumoca-compile` owns IDE/runtime semantic state above the phase crates so
LSP, WASM, and CLI cannot drift into separate cache/invalidation policies.

| Rule | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Source-root membership, status, cache hydration live here | `rumoca-compile` | Single source of truth for project membership |
| Incremental class graph + namespace/package views live here | `rumoca-compile` | One incremental story across all clients |
| Workspace roots and imported roots are semantically identical | `rumoca-compile` | Retention/restore differ; semantics do not |
| Clients MUST NOT implement their own invalidation policy or rebuild scope | tool-lsp / bind-wasm / CLI | Avoid divergent cache stories |
| `rumoca-tool-lsp` owns transport, async, cancellation, progress | tool-lsp | Editor delivery, not compile semantics |
| `rumoca-bind-wasm` and the CLI adapt input/output only | bind-wasm / CLI | They are clients, not owners |

Session snapshots are the read-side IDE/binding boundary. They MUST be
detached from the mutable host revision, allow concurrent reads, and reserve
exclusive locking for snapshot creation or query-cache warming.

Dependency fingerprint caches are session-owned. Rebuilt class hashes/edges
invalidate changed classes plus the reverse dependency closure, not every
cached model fingerprint.

### 11. Session Persistence Boundary

`rumoca-compile` MAY persist warm-restore state, scoped to source-root AST/index
plus resolved aggregate inputs. Typed/flat/DAE artifacts are NOT persisted by
default — they rebuild lazily behind dependency fingerprints.

| Persisted (MAY) | Not persisted (MUST NOT) |
|---|---|
| parsed-source-root cache files | typed-tree artifacts |
| file summaries, declaration indexes | flat-IR artifacts |
| package-membership / namespace state | DAE-IR artifacts |
| model names, class dependency graphs, dependency fingerprints | solve-IR artifacts |

Rationale: the warm-restore goal is to skip rebuilding front-end and resolved
dependency inputs on reopen, not to serialize the full downstream pipeline.

### 12. Runtime, Backend, Simulation Session, And Visualization Layering

```
compiler/session → DAE structural → solve-IR lowering → runtime contracts → solver backend → simulation session → reporting → visualization
```

| Rule | Owner | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Compilation/session orchestration | `rumoca-compile` | Pipeline coordination only; no runtime |
| DAE structural analysis (Pantelides, BLT, tearing, demotion) | `rumoca-phase-structural` | SPEC_0007 §Structural Transformation Scope |
| Solver-facing prepared data + row ops | `rumoca-ir-solve` | Backend-neutral execution IR |
| DAE → solve-IR lowering | `rumoca-phase-solve` | Lowering only, not structural mutation |
| Optimization/training orchestration | `rumoca-opt` | Consumes Solve/eval APIs; no Modelica semantics |
| Textual generated artifacts and templates | `rumoca-phase-codegen` | Jinja/minijinja rendering owns generated C, Rust, CUDA C, MLIR, FMI/eFMI and FMU/eFMU packaging text |
| GALEC `.alg` text (recorded exception) | `rumoca-ir-galec` | Typed AST printing per eFMI conformance; routed via template context (SPEC_0034 GAL-009) |
| eFMI packaging XML (`__content.xml`, manifests) | `rumoca-phase-codegen` | Rendered like FMI `modelDescription`; validators + generic checksum/container build step, not typed serializers (SPEC_0034 D3 amended) |
| Compiled/JIT execution adapter crates | `rumoca-exec-*` | Invoke tools, load artifacts, wrap Cranelift/LLVM/CUDA/NVRTC APIs, expose ergonomic runtime calls; no compiler semantics |
| Backend-neutral solver interface types | `rumoca-solver` | Single contract shared across backends |
| Concrete solver backends | `rumoca-solver-{diffsol,rk45,...}` | MUST consume solve-IR only; no DAE/phase deps |
| Simulation facade | `rumoca-sim` | Composes solvers/reporting/viz behind features |
| Simulation session APIs | separate from runtime contracts | Simulation sessions are the scheduled runtime surface |
| Reporting payload contracts | separate from viz assets | Payload is data; viz is presentation |
| Browser visualization assets | `packages/rumoca-web` | Frontend source/deps; no solver/backend policy |
| Transport-neutral lockstep I/O | `rumoca-codec` | Separate from protocol codecs |
| Protocol codecs (FlatBuffers, etc.) | `rumoca-codec-*` | No simulation, no controller, no HTTP, no scene |

Execution adapter crates are not compiler phases. `rumoca-exec-*`
crates wrap tool invocation, ABI adaptation, loading, GPU/accelerator
integration, packaging, or runtime compilation. Text-only targets stay in
codegen. Non-codegen phase crates MUST NOT
depend on target encoder/JIT libraries such as `wasm-encoder`, Cranelift,
Inkwell, LLVM ORC bindings, CUDA Driver APIs, or NVRTC; backend bytecode,
native/JIT execution, and device launch policy belong in `rumoca-exec-*`, above
the IR-lowering phase.

Target-language and target-format policy belongs in manifests/templates, not
Rust control flow. Rust MAY provide generic manifest parsing, template
rendering, safe path handling, schema validation, and language-neutral feature
probes over IR data. Rust MUST NOT hard-code target-language capabilities, file
layouts, emitted language names, or backend feature tables for textual targets
(C, Rust, CUDA C, MLIR, FMI/eFMI, or future custom targets). A textual/codegen
target should be addable with `target.toml` plus Jinja templates; required
capability declarations or unsupported-feature contracts must live in that
manifest schema and be enforced by generic validation. Unsupported manifest
capability failures MUST report stable `unsupported-feature:<feature_id>` from
the manifest feature ID so CI, MSL reports, and release summaries can aggregate
gaps without knowing the target language.

JIT targets follow the same layering rule as execution adapters, not textual
template targets. Cranelift, LLVM ORC/Inkwell, CUDA NVRTC/Driver, and browser
WebAssembly compilation are allowed only in backend-facing execution crates or
host bindings. They consume Solve IR or generated artifacts through a stable
execution ABI and share the prepared-interpreter equivalence tests of concrete
solver backends.

Steady-state CI rejects reverse dependencies across this chain. `rumoca-compile`
MUST NOT depend on concrete solvers or visualization assets; backend-selection
APIs MUST affect runtime behavior, not only metadata.

## Dependency Tiers

Workspace crates use six tiers. Dependencies flow downward.

```
Tier 6 — Binary & bindings: rumoca, bind-python, bind-wasm, contracts
Tier 5 — Integration/runtime: codec/input/solver/sim/opt/viz/tool-lsp families
Tier 4 — Orchestration: rumoca-compile, tool-fmt, tool-lint
Tier 3 — Phases & evaluation: rumoca-phase-*, rumoca-eval-*
Tier 2 — IR data: rumoca-ir-*
Tier 1 — Foundation: rumoca-core
```

Input boundary:

- `rumoca-input` owns abstract input identifiers, config compilation, local
  state, and signal mapping only. It MUST NOT depend on concrete adapters or
  native device crates such as `gilrs` or `crossterm`.
- Concrete adapters depend on `rumoca-input` and translate device events.
- Facades MAY compose input adapters behind opt-in scheduling/input features.

Simulation composition:

- Simulation apps are data/config composition, not per-vehicle framework code.
- `rumoca-sim` and CLI MAY wire axes from config; app-specific signal names,
  routes, controller conventions, and viewer keys stay in examples/config/assets.
- Durable simulation axes are separate crate families:
  - `rumoca-codec` and codec implementations own logical signal-frame encoding.
  - Transport crates own bytes-on-the-wire movement.
  - Solver crates own numerical integration backends.
  - Input crates own abstract input state and native device adapters.
  - Browser packages own HTTP/viewer assets and npm locks; Rust crates MAY
    serve prepared assets, but MUST NOT build frontend packages.
- Coupled and standalone modes share compiler/solver contracts; loop policy is runtime.
- Configured signal references MAY read compiled model values, local input state,
  runtime counters, and constants. The signal-reference language must stay in the
  simulation/config layer and MUST NOT leak into compiler IR.
