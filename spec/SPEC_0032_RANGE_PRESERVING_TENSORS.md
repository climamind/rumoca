# SPEC_0032: Range-Preserving Tensor IR

## Status
ACCEPTED

## Summary

Structured array/range equations stay compact through Flat, DAE, and Solve;
scalar rows are derived views, not recovered structure.

## Specification

### 1. Ownership And Domains

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Structured equation families stay authoritative | Flat/DAE IR | Prevents parallel scalar owners |
| Domains use `rumoca-core::StructuredIndexDomain` | Flat/DAE/Solve IR | One compact domain shape |
| Domain payloads are compact | IR serialization | Avoids O(N) metadata |
| Binder ids are stable and explicit | `StructuredIndexBinder` / phase maps | Names can shadow |
| Empty domains produce zero scalar rows | Scalar views | Valid zero-iteration ranges |

Structured families include source `for` equations, whole-array equations,
slices, comprehensions, boundary ranges, and connection-generated array
equations that are naturally ranged. Domain payloads must not serialize one
entry per scalar iteration except inside an explicitly materialized scalar view.
Stage-specific structured-equation ids remain stage-owned and must be mapped
explicitly when identity crosses phase boundaries.

### 2. Scalar Views

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Scalar rows are generated views | `rumoca-eval-solve` / structural phases | Single structured owner |
| View ordering is deterministic | Domain enumeration | Backend agreement |
| Views carry provenance | Scalar-view metadata | Diagnostics and fallback |
| No scalar-row reassembly | Solve lowering | Prevents fragile recovery |
| Unmaterialized interior rows are non-semantic placeholders | Flat/DAE structural metadata | Corner proof remains authoritative |

Domains enumerate in binder declaration order, lexicographic with the innermost
binder varying fastest, respecting explicit step direction. For each index
tuple, body equations emit in source/body order. Scalar views must preserve
parent structured/tensor id, index tuple, scalar row id, and instantiated
lhs/rhs or output expression.
Function projection derives slice shape from selector kind: `:` preserves the
axis, a confirmed scalar selector removes it without evaluating its value, and
compatible elementwise binary array operands retain that shape. Function-
projection shape inference declines unknown or array-valued selectors and
ranges with unknown compile-time length.

For a regular family whose interiors are not materialized, only the base and
per-binder neighbor rows carry the reconstruction proof. Structural rewrites of
an interior placeholder do not invalidate that proof; rewrites of a corner row
must discard the family metadata unless a new proof is produced.

### 3. DAE Canonical Form

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Structured DAE contains no source `der(...)` | DAE lowering | MLS Appendix B form |
| Derivative families map to canonical slots | DAE structured family | Explicit state identity |
| No parallel scalarized owner | DAE IR | Avoids drift |
| Orphan pruning counts exact scalar references on both equation sides | Structural phases | An explicit scalar lhs is a live owner use; a shaped slice/base lhs owns only the exact scalar projection proven by DAE dimensions and `scalar_count`; an aggregate base alias alone does not keep unrelated scalar leaves |

DAE lowers colon-slice multiplication to a scalar dot product only when both
operands are proven rank-one vectors of equal width. Proven scalar operands,
including scalar compound expressions, retain elementwise vector scaling. A
conditional is proven scalar only when every condition, branch value, and the
else value are proven scalar; unresolved function/builtin calls, unknown widths,
and higher-rank shapes remain unprojected rather than acquiring broadcast
semantics.

A source family such as `der(u[i, j]) = w[i, j]` is represented as residuals
over canonical derivative slots/state metadata. The structured node owns the
compact index domain and maps each tuple to the corresponding derivative/output
slot.

### 4. Solve Tensor Nodes

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| `ComputeNode::Map` is elementwise | Solve IR | Pointwise tensor semantics |
| `ComputeNode::AffineStencil` is neighborhood access | Solve IR | Affine offset semantics |
| Solve grouping is semantic | `rumoca-phase-solve` | Backends do not redefine IR |
| Scalar fallback uses shared scalarization | `rumoca-eval-solve` | One ordering implementation |
| A direct non-constructor call whose exact function symbol declares exactly one output with non-empty dimensions declines per-lane projection when whole-call symbolic projection declines | `rumoca-phase-solve` | The array runtime receives one whole call instead of one duplicated array-valued call per scalar lane |

`Map` represents canonical DAE residual families that are elementwise over a
compact domain, including `der(u) = w` after DAE canonicalization. `AffineStencil`
comes from structured DAE domains plus affine operand proofs; Solve lowering
must not rediscover stencils by scanning anonymous scalar rows. Backends may
fuse or split generated kernels as target-local codegen, but the reported
kernel inventory must match the generated work.

For direct structured initialization, the same domain can pair a residual `Map`
with a compact target `TensorOutputMap`. The target map is the sole scalar-view
mapping for that family; creating parallel `row_targets`, `StructuredProgram`,
or `Vec<Vec<LinearOp>>` ownership is forbidden on the compact path. The
`ComputeBlock` remains the sole owner of the Map; initialization metadata refers
to it by node index. `rumoca-eval-solve` executes the base program and affine
strides natively over the domain, without per-cell `LinearOp` construction.
Direct and fixed-start target ranges form an exact, non-overlapping affine
partition. Fixed-start array coverage is derived from the resolved contiguous
layout base and shape without scalar row-target materialization. Descending
source binders are normalized to an ascending execution domain by selecting the
corresponding source base and corners; target maps therefore remain canonical
positive-stride maps without changing source-index semantics. Empty domains
produce no direct node, singleton dimensions require no corner, and only
dimensions with at least two values contribute a stride proof.
Direct-family owners are recorded when nodes are emitted; downstream coverage
must consume that explicit association rather than zip against the source
family list, because empty source domains emit no node.
Corner-derived load, constant, and target strides are admissible only after
Solve lowering proves the reconstructed program against every materialized
family cell. That proof reuses one lowering context and releases each scalar
proof row before visiting the next. Missing indexed-record assignments are
resolved only for references in the current proof cell; retaining a
family-sized assignment map or tuple/equation/row ownership is forbidden.
Direct-family `LoadY` dependencies form a compact causal projection
order in the existing initialization projection envelope. Cycles, unavailable
interiors, non-affine values, and random/impure operations fail closed at the
first owning source span; executing a self-consistent but unproven
reconstruction is forbidden. Wire and runtime admission require SSA register
flow, definition-before-use, and exactly one terminal `StoreOutput` whose
reaching definition is a subtraction with exactly one operand equal to the
verified target-`LoadY` register. The other operand's complete
reaching-definition closure must not reach that target load; malformed source
shapes and register overwrites fail closed. One Solve-IR helper validates every
load/constant stride's operation position, operation kind, domain dimension,
and finite constant value for compact admission, phase validation, and native
or scalar evaluation.

### 5. Ownership Boundaries

| Thing | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| `StructuredIndexDomain`, binder ids | `rumoca-core` | Cross-IR data shape |
| Domain semantic normalization/evaluation | Owning phase crate | Needs semantic context |
| Solve tensor scalar-view generation | `rumoca-eval-solve` | Shared fallback boundary |
| Native tensor rendering | backend/codegen target | Target-local optimization |

Name resolution, parameter-bound evaluation, zero-size handling, and ordering
normalization are phase/evaluation behavior, not IR-crate behavior.
