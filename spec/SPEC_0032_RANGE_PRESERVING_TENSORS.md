# SPEC_0032: Range-Preserving Tensor IR

## Status
ACCEPTED

## Summary

Structured array/range equations stay compact through Flat, DAE, and Solve;
scalar rows are derived views, not recovered structure.

## Specification

### 1. Ownership And Domains

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Structured equation families stay authoritative | Flat/DAE IR | Prevents parallel scalar owners |
| Domains use `rumoca-core::StructuredIndexDomain` | Flat/DAE/Solve IR | One compact domain shape |
| Domain payloads are compact | IR serialization | Avoids O(N) metadata |
| Binder ids are stable and explicit | `StructuredIndexBinder` / phase maps | Names can shadow |
| Empty domains produce zero scalar rows | Scalar views | Valid zero-iteration ranges |

Structured families include source `for` equations, whole-array equations,
slices, comprehensions, boundary ranges, and connection-generated array
equations that are naturally ranged. Domain payloads must not serialize one
entry per scalar iteration except inside an explicitly materialized scalar view.
Stage-specific structured-equation ids remain stage-owned and must be mapped
explicitly when identity crosses phase boundaries.

### 2. Scalar Views

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Scalar rows are generated views | `rumoca-eval-solve` / structural phases | Single structured owner |
| View ordering is deterministic | Domain enumeration | Backend agreement |
| Views carry provenance | Scalar-view metadata | Diagnostics and fallback |
| No scalar-row reassembly | Solve lowering | Prevents fragile recovery |

Domains enumerate in binder declaration order, lexicographic with the innermost
binder varying fastest, respecting explicit step direction. For each index
tuple, body equations emit in source/body order. Scalar views must preserve
parent structured/tensor id, index tuple, scalar row id, and instantiated
lhs/rhs or output expression.

### 3. DAE Canonical Form

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Structured DAE contains no source `der(...)` | DAE lowering | MLS Appendix B form |
| Derivative families map to canonical slots | DAE structured family | Explicit state identity |
| No parallel scalarized owner | DAE IR | Avoids drift |

A source family such as `der(u[i, j]) = w[i, j]` is represented as residuals
over canonical derivative slots/state metadata. The structured node owns the
compact index domain and maps each tuple to the corresponding derivative/output
slot.

### 4. Solve Tensor Nodes

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| `ComputeNode::Map` is elementwise | Solve IR | Pointwise tensor semantics |
| `ComputeNode::AffineStencil` is neighborhood access | Solve IR | Affine offset semantics |
| Solve grouping is semantic | `rumoca-phase-solve` | Backends do not redefine IR |
| Scalar fallback uses shared scalarization | `rumoca-eval-solve` | One ordering implementation |

`Map` represents canonical DAE residual families that are elementwise over a
compact domain, including `der(u) = w` after DAE canonicalization. `AffineStencil`
comes from structured DAE domains plus affine operand proofs; Solve lowering
must not rediscover stencils by scanning anonymous scalar rows. Backends may
fuse or split generated kernels as target-local codegen, but the reported
kernel inventory must match the generated work.

For direct structured initialization, the same domain can pair a residual `Map`
with a compact target `TensorOutputMap`. The target map is the sole scalar-view
mapping for that family; creating parallel `row_targets`, `StructuredProgram`,
or `Vec<Vec<LinearOp>>` ownership is forbidden on the compact path. The
`ComputeBlock` remains the sole owner of the Map; initialization metadata refers
to it by node index. `rumoca-eval-solve` executes the base program and affine
strides natively over the domain, without per-cell `LinearOp` construction.
Direct and fixed-start target ranges form an exact, non-overlapping affine
partition. Fixed-start array coverage is derived from the resolved contiguous
layout base and shape without scalar row-target materialization. Descending
source binders are normalized to an ascending execution domain by selecting the
corresponding source base and corners; target maps therefore remain canonical
positive-stride maps without changing source-index semantics. Empty domains
produce no direct node, singleton dimensions require no corner, and only
dimensions with at least two values contribute a stride proof.
Direct-family owners are recorded when nodes are emitted; downstream coverage
must consume that explicit association rather than zip against the source
family list, because empty source domains emit no node.
Corner-derived load, constant, and target strides are admissible only after
Solve lowering proves the reconstructed program against every materialized
family cell. That proof reuses one lowering context and releases each scalar
proof row before visiting the next. Missing indexed-record assignments are
resolved only for references in the current proof cell; retaining a
family-sized assignment map or tuple/equation/row ownership is forbidden.
Direct-family `LoadY` dependencies form a compact causal projection
order in the existing initialization projection envelope. Cycles, unavailable
interiors, non-affine values, and random/impure operations fail closed at the
first owning source span; executing a self-consistent but unproven
reconstruction is forbidden. Wire and runtime admission require SSA register
flow, definition-before-use, and a terminal `StoreOutput` whose reaching
definition is the verified target-`LoadY` subtraction; register overwrites fail
closed.

### 5. Ownership Boundaries

| Thing | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| `StructuredIndexDomain`, binder ids | `rumoca-core` | Cross-IR data shape |
| Domain semantic normalization/evaluation | Owning phase crate | Needs semantic context |
| Solve tensor scalar-view generation | `rumoca-eval-solve` | Shared fallback boundary |
| Native tensor rendering | backend/codegen target | Target-local optimization |

Name resolution, parameter-bound evaluation, zero-size handling, and ordering
normalization are phase/evaluation behavior, not IR-crate behavior.
