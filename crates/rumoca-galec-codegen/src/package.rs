//! The projection's output artifact: [`AlgorithmCodePackage`].
//!
//! # Construction contract (GAL-002/GAL-004)
//!
//! A package is constructed by the lowering entry point
//! [`crate::lower_to_algorithm_code`], which runs, in order:
//!
//! 1. [`crate::admissibility::check_admissibility`] over the untouched DAE;
//! 2. [`crate::classify::classify_variables`] +
//!    [`crate::manifest_vars::build_manifest_variables`];
//! 3. equation/method-body lowering into the GALEC block (guarded-`f_z`/
//!    `f_m` unwrapping, dependency ordering of the DoStep assignments,
//!    builtin mapping per T8, explicit casts per T5, `'previous(x)'` state
//!    commits at the end of DoStep per T2);
//! 4. post-validation (GAL-004): `rumoca_ir_galec::validate` over the block,
//!    and a full typed-manifest assembly
//!    (`crate::manifest_context::algorithm_code_manifest::AlgorithmCodeManifest::new`
//!    with a render-time UUID/timestamp/checksum) so the manifest fragment
//!    is proven assemblable before the package is returned.
//!
//! The fields are public so the eFMU emission layer can read them, and the
//! rendering facades re-run the GALEC validator on the block
//! ([`crate::emit::render_algorithm_code`] /
//! `render_algorithm_code`): a package assembled or mutated
//! outside the lowering entry point cannot print un-validated GALEC.
//!
//! The package never aliases or mutates the input DAE; it owns its data.
//!
//! The manifest side is a *fragment*, not a full
//! `AlgorithmCodeManifestParts`: `ManifestAttributes` (UUID, strict-UTC
//! generation timestamp, tool string) and `Files` checksums are
//! packaging-time facts owned by the eFMU emission layer (`rumoca-compile`
//! driving the packaging build step), not by the projection.
