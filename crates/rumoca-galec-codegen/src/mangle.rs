//! Modelica name → GALEC [`Name`] mapping (GAL-015, trap T13).
//!
//! # Scheme
//!
//! For a scalarized Modelica variable name `n`:
//!
//! 1. **Pre-slot** (generated `__pre__.x` slot, detected structurally by the
//!    classifier): maps to the quoted identifier `'previous(x)'` — the T2
//!    convention for materialized previous-value state.
//! 2. **Plain identifier**: when `n` is lexically a legal GALEC identifier
//!    (ASCII letter first, then ASCII alphanumerics/underscores) *and* not
//!    reserved ([`rumoca_ir_galec::builtins::is_reserved_name`]: keywords,
//!    future-reserved words, the `__` prefix space, builtins including
//!    lifted variants, Appendix C names, predefined signal names), `n` maps
//!    to itself as a plain identifier.
//! 3. **Quoted identifier**: everything else (hierarchical names `a.b[2]`,
//!    reserved collisions like `absolute` or `if`, `__`-prefixed names) maps
//!    to the quoted identifier `'n'`, carrying the original scalarized name
//!    verbatim for traceability.
//!
//! Names that cannot be a single quoted lexeme (containing `'`, whitespace,
//! control characters — e.g. flattened Modelica quoted identifiers such as
//! `Logic.'1'`) are rejected with `ET012` rather than rewritten: rewriting
//! would lose the original name and risk collisions.
//!
//! # Injectivity and reserved-disjointness (by construction)
//!
//! - Rule 2 outputs equal only when inputs are equal (identity), and are
//!   never reserved (checked).
//! - Rule 3 outputs equal only when inputs are equal (identity on quoted
//!   content). Quoted identifiers are a separate lexeme class, disjoint
//!   from keywords/builtins by the grammar.
//! - Rules 2 and 3 cannot collide with each other: a given string is routed
//!   deterministically to exactly one rule.
//! - Rule 1 outputs `previous(x)` contain parentheses; scalarized Modelica
//!   names never contain parentheses outside Modelica quoted segments (which
//!   carry `'` and are rejected), so the pre-space is disjoint from rules
//!   2/3. Defensively, unquoted source names containing `(`/`)` are rejected
//!   so this argument holds even for corrupt input.
